1. So do I need multiple accounts in order to use multiple workers?
	-Yes. Put all of them into the usersettings.json file and set them to the same id.

3. For a continuous area larger than -r 30? What is the best, increase the radius and workers or a split in different id's?
	-You want that whole area, don't split. You want parts of it, better split it, i.e. run multiple instances
	of the tool with different ids. Empty areas get removed in subsequent runs, don't worry about those.
	
4. Do the id's still attach on each other or I have to estimate on google maps?
	-They don't attach and in most cases it's better to just use one id anyway.
	If you want them to attach, yes you'll have to use google maps.

5. I just want to set it up efficiently for area XXX and do XXX, but I am unsure for example, how many accounts I would need.
	-See question 3. Scan time decreases linearly with the amount of workers, twice the workers, half the time.
	Also increases quadratically with scan range, twice the range, four times the duration.
	Try it out with some workers and just use a good estimate.
	
6. I have many empty cells, is that bad?
	-Water cells are mostly empty, but even in cities you have some empty cells and in rural areas you have many of them as well. If your ip gets soft banned, you'll have only empty cells, that's very bad.
	
7. What is that time format? How can I convert it into something readable?
	-It's the timezone independent unix time, you can easily transform that into any local time format. Example: http://www.unixtimestamp.com/

8. Key Error?
	-Make sure you have the newest settings file, sometimes new settings get added and when they're not found, it raises a key error.
	
9. "Error: The settings file is not in a valid format, No JSON object could be decoded." Any advice?
	-You messed up the settings file format. Validate the file with this: http://jsonlint.com/
	Mind your commas and brackets, don't use fancy quotation marks. Change it step by step and revalidate to find the error.
	
10. "It's like its scanning all the spawn points exactly when it shouldn't be./ It's finding less pokemon after catchup."
	-Well then it's definitely a system clock time issue, don't you think so? The times in the learning file are exact and don't depend on your system clock but on the Niantic one and are pretty reliable as expected from a time based game. There is a line "safetysecs = 3" in the main0.py, you can change it to something higher like 30, that should do the trick, but rather than telling my tool to scan every spawn point 30 seconds late, which may be just in time, if your system clock is faster by 30 seconds, you should just get your system clock synchronized.

11. "It seems to be finding less pokemon after catchup/after a while."
	-During catchup it has to scan all points, that spawned in the last hour and are still active in a short time. After that it only has to scan the new spaws, which are very few in comparison to that, so your console is getting less pokemon to show per time. It's similar with non iscan mode.
